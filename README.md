# Data Visualization using Jupyter Notebook
## Project Overview

This project demonstrates data exploration and visualization using two fascinating datasets:

Indian_foods.csv – Information on a variety of Indian dishes, including ingredients, preparation time, cuisine, and region.

Billionaires_stats.csv – Data about global billionaires, covering industries, countries, net worth, and rankings.

The goal is to apply Python-based visualization techniques to uncover patterns, distributions, and meaningful insights from these datasets.

## Key Features

#### Indian Foods Dataset:

Analysis of dishes by cuisine and region.

Exploration of cooking time and complexity.

Ingredient-based insights and trends.

#### Billionaires Dataset:

Industry and country-wise billionaire distribution.

Net worth comparisons across countries and sectors.

Ranking patterns and wealth concentration analysis.
